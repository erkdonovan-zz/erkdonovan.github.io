The company that my day job is for (The Blueprint) secured and moved into our own office last week. And with that we needed to have a team dinner to celebrate! One of the items that we are selling online is the Nomiku, a sous vide home cooking kitchen tool, and my co-worker Dan (pictured below) had been using one for a few months. 

I was asked to take photos of the processes and the dinner to document the evening for a post on our website. I don’t eat steak. I don’t like meat that is still pink, I mentally can not eat food that appears to be bleeding, even if it isn’t. But I loved the chance to take the photos. I loved that my work asked me to do it.

Dan started the steaks during the day, prepping them with salt and then a few with steak sauce, and then let them cook in the pot of circulating water. I’m guessing that dinner tasted well. I had some of the pasta salad and a slice of pizza. The food looked good.
