title: Hmmm... I'm a Front-End Dev?
---

Last Thursday night, around 9pm, we wrapped up the last class in the Part-Time HTML & CSS fall program and with that I’m officially a Front-End Developer!

This coming week we have two evenings of program help and to ask any other questions we might have. Then we have demo day.

I’m working hard on finishing my last project (and compiling questions) for Tuesday’s help session. I’m also working on finishing the holiday card for where I work, which I am super excited about being asked to build!

Since September I’ve been spending two nights a week learning to code and another three actually trying to code and build websites and random index page files, testing out different ideas.

I’ve lost hours of reading and hours of painting or crocheting or drawing, but I couldn’t be happier spending that time in front of a computer screen stringing letters and characters together to form skillfully laid out grids of information. I love when I break my site and have to figure out what happened (usually I’m missing a closing div tag). 

I’m happy. I’m so happy!
