  <h1>Yesterday I called myself a Dev!</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <h2 id="tonight-completes-the-fourth-week-of-my-part-time-coding-program-with-hackeryou-on-web-development">Tonight completes the fourth week of my part-time coding program with HackerYou on Web Development</h2>

<p>I first learned what HTML was in grade 10 when I wanted to see how websites where built. So one day I got a book on it and I started building very basic, poorly designed, frame based websites for my friend’s sport teams and fan pages for celebrities I was a fan of.</p>

<p><em>And then one day I just stopped.</em></p>

<p>I never wanted to work in tech growing up. I had always been great with computers and was able to learn software quickly, but I had a set back that same year. In grade 10, I took the Intro to Drafting class in high school. I was in love with architecture and buildings and how you could use a computer to draw plans. What ended up happening, a side from me learning AutoCAD, as I was the only girl in a class of 11, where the computer pods each held five students. Hence, I sat alone. Every day. I was consistently reminded by the other students that it was not a place for me or for other girls.</p>

<p>My teacher was amazing though. I finished the course workload in the first three weeks, this is what happens when focus meets “no one wants to talk to you”. So, he got the school to give me access to Adobe Flash and Photoshop and I taught myself how to use them. When the class ended I had the highest mark in the class, even though I failed to complete the final independent project. I had also been asked to do my grade 11 co-op with GM, which I turned down upon hearing all my co-workers would be male (my mom still regrets this decision, I do not).</p>

<p>I went on to take a few business computer classes in grade 11 and 12, I was apart of the editing crew on the News Team, and in college I pretty much did everyone else’s website project in Year 3 Computers (I was studying Sport Management).</p>

<p>But! Now I work in the tech industry, and although I am not on the dev team and the closet I come to working with code is helping my customers figure out code issues on their websites, I wanted to re-learn HTML and CSS. And now I am!</p>

<p>Two nights a week I walk from work over to The Lab on Queen St W and I learn to code for two hours with other students, one teacher, and two+ awesome mentors that help us when we are confused. And it’s two nights a week that I am enjoying and happy to be extending my “in front of the computer” hours.</p>

<p>I will be taking the Web Development course until mid-December and by then I should have a well rounded understanding of HTML5, CSS3, and responsive design! And yesterday!, while one of my co-workers (a real dev) was showing me what something meant a few others where talking (loudly!) and I asked them to shhh because the devs where working, including me!</p>
